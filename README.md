# Obsidian Forms Plugin

Publish beautiful forms and get responses straight to your vault

## How does it work

Link a folder from your Obsidian vault and use the web interface to easily create, edit, and manage forms. Obsidian will sync automatically, so all your filled form entries stay up to date in your vault.


### 1. Form Creation
- Choose an Obsidian folder as the home directory for the form.
